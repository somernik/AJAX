Exercise 1
    create a blank html page that is linked to an external javascript file named OO.js
    Create a class definition for a student. The class definition should have instance variables for the name and email as well as getters/setters for the instance variables. 
    There should also be a prototype method named register. The register method should take 2 parameters: the email and the courseName.
    The method should then do an alert of the 2 incoming parameters. Ex. bgates@msn.com registered for the AJAX course.
    Create an instance of a student named student1. Set the name and the email using the setters. Alert the name and email using the getters.
    Create a 2nd instance of a student named student2. Call the register method passing in "sjobs@mac.com" and "iPhone development" as the 2 parameters.
